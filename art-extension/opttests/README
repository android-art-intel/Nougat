ART Optimization Test Suite

TEST SUITE STRUCTURE

It is supposed that tests directories structure is as follows:

src/
    OptimizationTests/
        Test_Package_1/
            Testdir_001/
                Main.java, package OptimizationTests.Subsuite.Testdir_001
                other *.java
                [build]
                [run]
                [expected.txt],f there is no expected.txt, you should provide diffexp script to check the test exit
                [add_art_args]
                [postproc]
            Testdir_002/
            ......
        [build]
        [run]
        [add_art_args]
        [postproc_common]
    Test_Package_2/
    .....

As an example of test directories structure, please see OptimizationTests packages.

Unless test package or test contains its own build, run or diff, it uses default build, run and diff from etc/ directory.
The scope of build/run/diff can be test level or package level.

Each test package or test can set
    - it's own additional art options in the file named add_art_args,
    - postproc script that accepts logcat as a parameter.
So the scope of add_art_args and postproc could be test level or package level. Package level post-processing script should be named postproc_common.

QA area
-------

Tests cover optimizations in ART.

Origin
------

Test suite is developing by QA in connection with developers team.


How to run the tests
--------------------

How to run a subset of the tests
--------------------------------

Before building and running tests make sure that you have a valid path to JAVA_HOME and to ANDROID_SDK_ROOT.

To build AutoFastJNIDetection package you need to define the following environment:

export JAVAH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin/javah
export JAVA_INC=${JAVA_HOME}/include
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=<>
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME_64=<>
export NDK_SYS_ROOT=${ANDROID_NDK_HOME}/platforms/android-18/arch-x86
export NDK_SYS_ROOT_64=${ANDROID_NDK_HOME_64}/platforms/android-20/arch-x86_64
export NDK_SYS_ROOT_ARM=<>/platforms/android-18/arch-arm/
export NDK_SYS_ROOT_ARM64=<>/platforms/android-21/arch-arm64/
export INCL=${NDK_SYS_ROOT}/usr/include/
export INCL_64=${NDK_SYS_ROOT_64}/usr/include/
export CC=${ANDROID_NDK_HOME}/toolchains/x86-4.8/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/i686-linux-android-gcc
export CC_64=${ANDROID_NDK_HOME_64}/toolchains/x86_64-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86/bin/x86_64-linux-android-gcc
export CC_ARM=${ANDROID_NDK_HOME}/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.8/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc
export CC_ARM64=<>/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-gcc


$ export VM_ARGS="<a list of args >"
$ export VM_RUNTIME=[DVM|ART|ART64]
$ export VM_COMMAND=[dalvikvm|dalvikvm64]

$ ./run-tests -h
   Usage: run-tests [-hvprd] [PACKAGELIST=... TESTLIST=... TESTS=... TEST_LIST=... VM_ARGS=... RESULTS_DIR=... TIMEOUT=... EXCLUDE=... ANDROID_BUILD_TOP=...  RERUNS=... STRESS_RUNNER=...]

   -h: prints this message
   -v: set verbose mode 'on', default mode is 'off'
   -p: set postprocessing 'on' (it means that logcat will be checked according to the postproc script), default is 'off'
   -r: set regular run 'on' (it means that logcat will be removed for all passed tests), default is 'off' (useful for creating and debugging tests)
   -d: run the tests using the host virtual machine; ANDROID_BUILD_TOP pointing to the build tree should be defined

   PACKAGELIST="<list of packages to be run (or regular expressions corresponding to package names) >", e.g. PACKAGELIST="ShortMethodsInlining Loop"
                         default PACKAGELIST is "all"
                         deprecated: use TESTS or TEST_LIST
   If only one package is set, TESTLIST can contain the list of tests to be run.

   TESTLIST="<list of tests (or regular expressions corresponding to test names) to be run in defined package>",
            e.g. TESTLIST="InvokeDirectRange_a_007 InvokeDirectRange_a_008"
                         default TESTLIST is "all"
                         deprecated: use TESTS or TEST_LIST

   TESTS="a list of test names separated with spaces"
                        test name should be written as <package_name>/test_name>, e.g. CopyPropagation/Mixed_02,
                        or as <package_name>, e.g. as CopyPropagation; in this case all tests from CopyPropagation package are executed.
                        default: n/a.
                        If the value is not defined, then the list of tests is taken from TEST_LIST.

   TEST_LIST=<the name of a file containing the list of tests or test packages>
                         default name is <root_dir>/testlist
                         If the file does not exist, then all tests will be executed

   VM_ARGS="<list of dalvikvm arguments>" e.g. VM_ARGS="-Xint:jit -Xjitverbose"
                         default VM_ARGS="-Xint:jit"
   VM_ARGS_GO_OVER="<a list of dalvikvm options that should be added to the dalvikvm command line one by one>"
                         so that all the tests will be executed a few times
                         with one of the options added to VM_ARGS list each time.
                         default list for VTuneSupportTests is -Xjitvtuneinfo:jit
                         default value for other test suites is empty
   RESULTS_DIR=<path to directory with test results>
                         default RESULTS_DIR is <current directory>/results
   TIMEOUT=<N>, where N is the number of seconds to wait before terminating the test
                         default N is 10
   EXCLUDE=<path to exclude list>
                         default EXCLUDE is <current directory>/exclude
   ANDROID_BUILD_TOP=<path to the build tree>
                         default is not defined
   ANDROID_LOG_TAGS=<host mode verbosity level>
                         default ANDROID_LOG_TAGS=":D"
   RERUNS=<N>, where N is the number test reruns in case of post-processing failure, which could be due to jitting is not 100% garanteed
               Aimed to reduce false alarms during patch testing
   STRESS_RUNNER=[on|off] defines stressed mode of run, for which StressRunner is used

Before running tests you need explicitly set VM_RUNTIME=[ART|ART64] and VM_COMMAND=[dalvikvm|daalvikvm64]

Use unified script run.sh to run the whole suite.

Examples 
--------

$ export VM_ARGS="-Xcompiler-option --compiler-filter=O2"
$ export VM_RUNTIME=ART64
$ export VM_COMMAND=dalvikvm64
$ ./run-tests -p PACKAGELIST=LoopAccumulationSinking

How to run the tests in host mode
----------------------------------

$ export ANDROID_BUILD_TOP=<path to dir where host mode build is located i.e. path to 'out' dir>
$ HOST_MODE=on ./run.sh
   or
$ ./run.sh -d 

Test results
------------

Test results are collected in RESULTS_DIR, which is `pwd`/'results' by default. 
Each test has it's own result directiry with

logcat
output.txt
testlog.txt

To save disk space you can use -r option. In this case logcat will be saved only if the test failed.

Execution time
--------------

The test suite is constanly being developed. While this README is being written, the suite contains about 1500 tests which execution time is more then an hour.


How to build the tests
-----------------------

Before building and running tests make sure that you have a valid path to JAVA_HOME and to ANDROID_SDK_ROOT

$ ./build -h
   The script compiles or clean test packages.
   Usage: build [-h] [ MODE=..., PACKAGELIST=..., DEPLOY_DIR=..., VM_RUNTIME=[DVM|ART] ]

   -h: prints this message
   -v: set verbose mode 'on', default mode is 'off'

   MODE=[compile|clean], default MODE is 'compile'
   PACKAGELIST="<list of packages to be compiled or cleaned>" e.g. PACKAGELIST="ShortMethodsInlining Loop"
                         default PACKAGELIST is 'all'
   DEPLOY_DIR=<path to directory with test binaries>
                         default DEPLOY_DIR is <current directory>
   VM_RUNTIME - you need explicitly set it in case of ART

   In case of empty arguments list the script will compile all packages in the current directory to <curent directory>/bin

Example:

$ ./build PACKAGELIST=CopyPropagation VM_RUNTIME=ART
